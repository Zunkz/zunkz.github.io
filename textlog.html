<html>2024-11-14 18:14 UTC - You: <br/> If you think it's bad for Zunkz to tell people to kys, then why'd you say it?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:15 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Zunkz is the disgusting type of person, to go around and harrass people, like people that are my friends, shaming them and never asking if they are trying to change, he never tells anybody peoples success and includes the good things of people.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:15 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Like me for example<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:15 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> He calls me a pedophile<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:15 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Okay? Do you know how many people don't think of me like that anymore? None of<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:16 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> A lot of people forgave me, and even the minor at the time years, ago. Forgave me, there an adult now, and we're on very good terms<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:16 UTC - You: <br/> Still doesn't change that you did it<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:16 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> So, maybe you should interview the people he harasses because all he does now is show people evidence that 3 almost 4 years fucking old that won't really effect me anymore<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:17 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Okay, and it doesn't change the fact that he's a Zoophile, and make think any less of him and how he should be treated<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:17 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Like you quoted, Cat.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:17 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> "Treat people how you wanna be treated."<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:17 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> And that right there is how I'm gonna treat him.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:18 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> You wouldn't imagine the amount of friendships I've saved? And how many people think of me as a better person? And these are all people who he manipulated to never speak to me again, who NOW fucking hate him.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:18 UTC - You: <br/> You don't know who I am lmao, Zunkz just sent a screenshot of both of your guy's texts in a gc I'm in. Funnily enough though, Cat happens to be in the same gc.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:19 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I really don't care what your group full of Zoophile supporters are sharing<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:19 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> What's happening is gonna keep happening.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:19 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> And it's not going to stop.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:20 UTC - You: <br/> It's just a gc, it's not meant to support Zunkz specifically. I'm only in it cause a different mutual added me into it. And why do you think constantly harassing him over this stuff makes you any better?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:20 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Until he actually gets it through his fucking head, to actually leave me, and my friends like dander, and others who done fucked up shit? I can remove everything and even get him unbanned from the places that I got him banned from.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:21 UTC - You: <br/> If you do the same thing then he'll most likely stop. He's continuing because you're continuing.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:21 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> If you get him to stop harassing me ? And my friends? Absolutely I'll stop. Because as I said DANDER has been wanting to do shit to him a lot, but guess who's talked him out of it? Me.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:22 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Dander actually questioned if we should try to be NICE to him, but why would I wanna be nice to the guy who leaked my fathers number online.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:22 UTC - You: <br/> Didn't you guys leak WAY more than that? You know, his old address, his phone number, etc?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:22 UTC - You: <br/> Dander actually questioned if we should try to be NICE to him, but why would I wanna be nice to the guy who leaked my fathers number online.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:24 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> And especially calling me a fucking pedophile. I'm sorry? But, you will not believe the process I went through to make sure people don't think of me as that. 

I'm actually getting unbanned from places, because I owned up to shit I've done. I've apologized to group owners, staff, and everything and ex-bfs of mine who I'm on good terms with, if I was such a horrible piece of shit, the police did do their job on me, they helped me seek a therapist! Lmao.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:25 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Being arrested isn't always the fucking output. Just because his father raped his sister and was sent in jail, is wayyyy too horrible to compare what I did, I was able to get my friends back even irl and forgave me.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:25 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Instead of him, looking down at me? He should be proud of me for things I'm doing.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:25 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Getting help? Apologizing to people? Trying to make up for the shit I've done.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:25 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Having a better mind setv<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:25 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Like tf? What does that tell you?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:26 UTC - You: <br/> Don't know why he'd be proud of someone harassing him<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:26 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Taste of his own medicine.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:26 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> It stings doesn't it?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:26 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> If it didn't you wouldn't be here<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:27 UTC - You: <br/> I couldn't care if Zunkz is jobless or homeless<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:28 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Okay. I couldn't care less that he is. I see it ironic and funny in my opinion<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:28 UTC - You: <br/> And with how far deep Zunkz is in this stuff, he couldn't get help even if he wanted to. Like you said, he's a "jobless fat fuck".<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:30 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> You know one of Zunkz's EX even contacted me. Scared. Apologizing to me. Avi ur not believing about everything and not seeing his actions. If something like that comes to me, that hurts that I have people almost everyday coming to me. Realizing it<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:31 UTC - You: <br/> Oh, trust me, I've seen lots of evidence. And what is it? The same fucking shit<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:31 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> And he can leak my number all he wants because it isn't my real number.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:31 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> It's a text now number which I'm not offended at all.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:32 UTC - You: <br/> Oh I already knew that cause I know you wouldn't use your real phone number<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:32 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Same shit or not? Just like you said to me. "Still doesn't change what you (he) did."<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:34 UTC - You: <br/> Same shit or not? Just like you said to me. "Still doesn't change what you (he) did."<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:34 UTC - You: <br/> If you want him to get help then hell him get help instead of breaking him down very slowly. If you changed/admitted to your wrongdoings, so can he, but how you're treating him isn't gonna make him do that.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:35 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> He has had every chance to help himself. If you support him so much? Why won't you tell him to get a fucking therapist? Apply for Medicaid? And such. I got a great therapist now, who has helped me. If I never got one, I wouldn't have nearly all the friends I've lost back in my life.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:37 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> But at the same time? Yeah I've owned up to it multiple times. But do you think it's healthy of him to keep bringing up the past? Like at all?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:37 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> It's not.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:38 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Dander made the same mistake, I made the same mistake, some friends irl made the same mistake and we were all stuck in the past, without moving on.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:41 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> And best part about my life rn, is I became a fucking uncle to my niece. And I've never been so proud of my life. And for him to keep calling me a pedo breaks my heart a lot, the things that he thinks I would do to kids, almost kills me. Because I made a promise to protect my Niece, always. I've grown from the evidence that he had on me, a lot of it fucking fake to. A lot of was complete out of context, which I had to explain to so many people.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:42 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I was 19, had a huge fucking ego. A bad of an ego like that THING you support, and I've opened my eyes. So honestly you can share this and post this on twitter all you want.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:42 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Him sharing this number alone. Proves to me he ain't ever gonna change.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:42 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Some people can.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:42 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> But can't.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:42 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> So what do you have to say next?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:43 UTC - You: <br/> Him posting the number is him showing more harassment<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:43 UTC - You: <br/> If someone texted my real number I'd post about it too<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:43 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Then I guess both of you are Doxxers?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:43 UTC - You: <br/> If you werent harassing him and contacting nearby job places he could get a job and afford to get help and get better but you probably ruined that chance now<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:44 UTC - You: <br/> Not doxxing if you blur the number<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:44 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> How did you get the number then? ðŸ˜Š<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:44 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> You realize people are showing me his announcements right?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:45 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Some of my friends are in there watching him.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:45 UTC - You: <br/> Zunkz forgot to blur the number in the gc, like I said<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:45 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> It doesn't matter.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:45 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Like, the only way I would stop, is if only he dropped everything that me and dander did in the past. We fucking did it??<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:45 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Okay?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:46 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Yeah we did those things, I'm owning up to all the shit I've done. All of my friends know about it. And their proud of how far I've come and how I've grown from it<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:46 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> As for dander I can't talk for him, he's an adult.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:47 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Him plastering it almost all the time. Isn't gonna make him a hero. It gets annoying. I don't lose anymore friends for it either, I've gained so much more friends after his last attempt. And guess what happened. Karma on him. Lost his TikTok.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:48 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> So I hope it was worth it for him.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:50 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> None of this would be even happening if he just stopped. ðŸ˜‚

At all. None of this would be happening. And I don't feel bad at all.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:51 UTC - You: <br/> None of this would be even happening if he just stopped. ðŸ˜‚

At all. None of this would be happening. And I don't feel bad at all.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:52 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> You think i feel bad for the guy, who sent pizzas, and plumbers to my house? 

The guy who leaked my fathers number on a stream? And the old house that's my parents I used to live in. 

Harassed my aunt, and told my sister to kill her self?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:53 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I'll say it to you rn.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:53 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I hope he honestly kill himself.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:53 UTC - You: <br/> Who says he won't get help if you drop it too?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:54 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> If he dropped it right now and promised<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:54 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> That he would droop that shit and stop calling me something that I'm improvising my entire vision on? The absolutely.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:54 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I'll delete all the account and disable everything that's been made on him.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:58 UTC - You: <br/> What about taking back the things you said to places? Calling all those places you called telling them that the info isn't true? He can't get a job if that info is out there.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:58 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Oh absolutely.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:58 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> But I'm not fucking doing anything until I get confirmation that he's gonna stop<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:59 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Cause this means permanently<br/><br/>2024-11-14 18:59 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> This means he can't bring the shit up anymore cause a lot of people are tired of getting it brought up<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:01 UTC - You: <br/> Have you said you'd do that before to hin directly?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:01 UTC - You: <br/> *him<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:01 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Yes. And he said the same thing to me before too, we did a VC call before. And then he fucking brought up the shit again.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:02 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> So he broke it<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:03 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> He remembers exactly who was there, it was me, him, and Starr.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:03 UTC - You: <br/> How long ago was that?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:03 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> About a year ago.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:03 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Even a lot of people questioned why tf he brought it up again.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:04 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> He did it at the time he exposed TimmyTheOtter<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:04 UTC - You: <br/> Have you reminded him about you dropping it if he dropped it since then?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:04 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> He WONT lmao. That's his problem.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:05 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Like he even loses followers when he keeps bringing it up, people are getting tired of it<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:05 UTC - You: <br/> The more and more you harass him the less likely he's gonna drop it<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:05 UTC - You: <br/> Like he even loses followers when he keeps bringing it up, people are getting tired of it<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:05 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Like, I'm not friends with Wolfgang at all, but I can tell you, he stopped talking about me because I remember calling him and apologizing for everything I've done and falsely copyright striking him.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:06 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> If you get him to drop it right now.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:06 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I will promise.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:06 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> To this day<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:06 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I will reverse the call I did, and leave a better message.

And, remove all the profiles. And website about him.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:07 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> But, I have to ask my group how they feel about it, because they are hurt from them.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:08 UTC - You: <br/> If they don't agree to drop it too then Zunkz most likely won't drop it. Get them to promise. Or we could also do this in a space or private call to discuss deeper on everything that would happen if he dropped it.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:08 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> No.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:09 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I'm not at all ever going to agree talking to them on a vc. Or them physically. Ever.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:09 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I'm sorry.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:09 UTC - You: <br/> Why is that?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:10 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Because, you don't know him like i do. He'll keep calling you names, record it. Post it on YouTube, even after you don't consent to it. And he will still post it. Or even stream jt<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:11 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> He has a huge history of it<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:11 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I'm only agreeing like this, if that's not gonna happen then I'm not continuing this conversation any further<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:15 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> There is a reason why he was kicked out of his last house, because of these problems. Even NIKO his ex room mate, even wants nothing to do with him, but Zunkz disrespects his wishes and brings him up. 

Like Niko, and his fiancÃ© want a happy life, and live happily not keep being brought up by Zunkz. Because it bothers NIKO a lot.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:16 UTC - You: <br/> Zunkz hasn't brought them up once since he left their place
And I know what Niko and his fiancÃ© went through and want because they told me ALL of the stuff they had on him.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:16 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Bull shit.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:17 UTC - You: <br/> I can get the screenshots right now<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:17 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I had to remind Niko the other couple days ago that Zunkz brought him up in an argument with me not even a month ago.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:17 UTC - You: <br/> I have everything Niko said to me<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:17 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> It's all old shit<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:18 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Niko doesn't even talk shit about me either. He wants me and him, to go our separate ways appropriately like we have been.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:19 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> And yes he did bring them up, he brought Niko up literally a week ago, about sending the problem I had back in 2021<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:19 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I had to tell Niko about it<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:19 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I wouldn't just randomly go to Niko and stirr up shit<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:23 UTC - You: <br/> I wouldn't just randomly go to Niko and stirr up shit<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:23 UTC - You: <br/> So you told Niko but showed no proof that Zunkz actually mentioned him?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:24 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I deleted the fucking chat right after and told him. How he brought up the qrt he sent lmao<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:26 UTC - You: <br/> Don't you think if someone was brought up months after saying they didn't want brought up that you should show them proof?<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:28 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Niko knows enough that if Zunkz brought them up proof doesn't need to be shown, knowing how he acts and handles shit<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:29 UTC - You: <br/> If you would've shown him that he did that Niko would've done something about it<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:29 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> No he wouldn't he made it very clear he doesn't want anything to do with Zunkz.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:30 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Don't speak to Niko.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:30 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Don't speak on Nikos half.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:30 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Because I only know he would do that because he made it very clear one day<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:31 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> But quit changing the subject. This ain't about NIKO<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:31 UTC - You: <br/> You brought it up, so you changed it<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:31 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Yeah, but you kept asking on it.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:32 UTC - You: <br/> Shouldn't have brought it up then<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:33 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> <a href="https://media.textnow.com/?t=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImRvZ2VwbGF5enl0NSIsImtleSI6IjkzMjNkMDVmLWJkMmUtNWE3NC04ZTQ5LTgyNTZjZGEyODA0YiJ9.Rot-5zSu9YOZ-PDbwXBxm0qYNho7ePC4OG8Djz0Zlr8&h=9323d05f-bd2e-5a74-8e49-8256cda2804b">Image message</a><br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:33 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> This right here<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:33 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Is why Daniel Gauthier, is never gonna change and is why I'm never gonna stop.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:34 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I would rather warn places and community's then let a Animal Molester work for places, I would rather keep getting him banned from places.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:36 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> So, guess what? It's gonna keep happening. It won't ever stop.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:36 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> So wine and fucking cry about it.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:41 UTC - You: <br/> Hope you realize him not having a home won't completely stop his internet access since there's so many places with public internet.

I wasn't speaking for Niko, I was saying what he said cause I asked him what you told me and when I asked if he had proof of the mention he said no one showed him anything so he did nothing about it. I can show you a screenshot of what he said if you want
If you got anything to say, then go ahead and say it<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:49 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I'm not saying anything else but. Shake on you for supporting a animal molester.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:49 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Shame* sorry<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:49 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> I'm spending time with family. ðŸ˜Š<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:50 UTC - You: <br/> Do I need to quote Cat's line he uses against the EvidenceIndex account?

And I never said him tweeting about you will save his life<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:52 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Now if you excuse me I'm gonna have fun with my family that I still speak to and hang with my parents who aren't a pedophile and haven't molested my sister unlike his did. Oh and of course having money feels great. Because having a job is great.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:53 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> We just keep winning. And seeing him fall like he is right now is amusing to us. Have a great night.<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:54 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Oh and also<br/><br/>2024-11-14 19:54 UTC - +13303825160: <br/> Thank you for being decently nice to me.</html>
